This is an exercise on data wrangling using the flights dataset:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
```

1. Filter flights to include only flights with an arrival delay greater than 2 hours (delays are recorded in minutes)  

2. Select columns in the flights table that contain delay times (note that the function `matches` can be used to select columns with names that matches a regular expression. See `?dplyr::select`)  

3. Find the minimum arrival delay (this can be a negative number) in the flights table. Use `summarize`.  

4. Find minimum arrival delay (again, can be a negative number) in the flights table for each destination airport. Use `group_by' and 'summarize`.  

5. List the name of all airlines and the number of flights for each airline in flights table. The `airlines` table has airline names.

6. (a): create a new column (use 'mutate') with total delay time for each flight  
   (b): replace any missing *total delay times* with the minimum total delay time
